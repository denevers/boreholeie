# trying to turn into BhML approach the following Segment-Sample association from EPOS Borehole model
# example from UU-SE (thx Henning Lorenz) : https://www.geodata.rocks/Segments/SD-5054_1_A-3
# may have missed elements (ex : association role) from the model (not yet YAML fluent)
# SG : tried to validate under http://www.yamllint.com/ and https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/.
